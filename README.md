# Onshape Basic CAD

## Caster Assignments

### Base

#### What I learned

This assignment served as an introduction to Onshape, which I had never used before. I learned how to sketch, extrude, extrude cut, and linear pattern in Onshape. I also began to become familiar with the different keyboard shortcuts, such as [c] for circle, [r] for center rectangle, [n] for normal to, and [d] for dimension. Many steps take a lot less time and work in Onshape than they do in Solidworks. 

### Mount

#### What I learned

For this assignment I continued to become more familiar with the keyboard shortcuts in Onshape. For this part we had to do more extrusions and extruded cuts as with the last assignment. 

### Fork

#### What I learned

For this part I learned how to use the chamfer, fillet, and mirror features in Onshape.  

### Wheel

#### What I learned

For this part we had to use the revolve feature to make the initial wheel, acircular pattern to do the spokes of the wheel, the fillet tool, and extruded cuts. 

### Tire

#### What I learned

This part didn't use any new functions; it was merely the revolving of a trapezoid and fillet. 

### Washer/Big Bearing

#### What I learned

### Axle + Collar

#### What I learned

I learned how to make multiple parts within a part studio that share the same geometry. To make the collar we had to select "new" under extrusion instead of "add". 

### Sub-Assembly: Wheel, Tire, Axle, Bearing, + Collar

#### What I learned

This assignment was the first time I used mates in Onshape. I learned how to use fasten mates vs. revolute mates, which allow the part to revolve

### Final Assembly

#### What I learned

I learned how to pull in extra parts from Onshape i.e. nuts and bolts, and how to apply them to the assembly. This assembly also required fasten and revolve mates in different places.
