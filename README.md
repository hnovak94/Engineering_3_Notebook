#### What I learned

This assignment served as an introduction to Onshape, which I had never used before. I learned how to sketch, extrude, extrude cut, and linear pattern in Onshape. I also began to become familiar with the different keyboard shortcuts, such as [c] for circle, [r] for center rectangle, [n] for normal to, and [d] for dimension. Many steps take a lot less time and work in Onshape than they do in Solidworks. 

### Caster Mount

#### What I learned

For this assignment I continued to become more familiar with the keyboard shortcuts in Onshape. For this part we had to do more extrusions and extruded cuts as with the last assignment.
